# Component Development

- Use function components with TypeScript interfaces for props
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- Prefer composition over prop drilling
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility

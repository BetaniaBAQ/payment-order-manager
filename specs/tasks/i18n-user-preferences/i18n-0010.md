# 0010: Translate shared components

## Context

Replace hardcoded strings in shared/reusable components with `t()` calls. These components are used across the app, so translating them provides the widest impact.

## Dependencies

- 0006 (i18n wired into root layout)
- 0008 (Spanish translations exist)
- 0009 (English translations exist)

## Files

- `src/components/shared/app-header.tsx` (edit)
- `src/components/shared/delete-confirm-dialog.tsx` (edit)
- `src/components/shared/error-boundary.tsx` (edit)
- `src/components/shared/empty-state.tsx` (edit — if it has internal strings)

## Requirements

1. Import `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` in each component
2. Replace hardcoded strings with `t('common:key')` calls
3. Components that receive labels as props (like `EmptyState`) — translate at call site, not inside the component

### `app-header.tsx`

- "Sign out" → handled by PreferencesDropdown (task 0005), but if any remaining strings exist, translate them

### `delete-confirm-dialog.tsx`

- Button labels: "Delete", "Deleting...", "Cancel"

### `error-boundary.tsx`

- "Something went wrong", "We've been notified...", "Reload page"

## No-gos

- Do not add `useTranslation` to pure UI primitives in `src/components/ui/` — only application components

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All shared components use `t()` for user-facing strings
- [ ] Strings display in Spanish by default
- [ ] Switching to English shows English translations
- [ ] No hardcoded user-facing strings remain in shared components
